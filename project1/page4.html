        2023年，他决定留学美国，经历了铺天盖地的自我挣扎和一系列挫折之后，他凭借运气和父母的拼命工作，考进了一所还不错的艺术学校，开始正式学习艺术。跟随父母的开导和劝诫，在那里学习起编程和新媒体。
        出于他的胆怯和过度思考，他习惯于逃离社交媒体，很少公开发布自己的作品。凭借着他高中为了应试学的几年英语，他从未准确的和老师表达过自己的作品和想法。在大学期间，他很迷茫，也不知道自己究竟想学什么，只是费尽心思的完成各个学科的作业，和学习英语。

        In 2023, he decided to study abroad in the United States. After experiencing overwhelming self-struggle and a series of setbacks, he managed to get into a decent art school with luck and her parents' hard work, beginning his formal study of art. Following his parents' guidance and advice, he pragmatically gave up photography to study programming and new media there.
        Due to his shyness and overthinking, he tended to avoid social media and rarely published his works publicly. Relying on the few years of English he learned in high school for exams, he never accurately expressed his works and ideas to his teachers. During his university years, he was confused and unsure about what he really wanted to study, focusing solely on completing assignments for various subjects and learning English.
